The technical and rights working groups are done. The descriptive metadata workgroup is working on mods xml to rdf. There is a meeting on the 21st to figure out a common way to deal with converting mods xml to rdf and which xsl's to use as the standard - use Library of Congress' or Columbia's.

IR Interest Group (Emily Toner)  
The Institutional Repository is a new interest group [https://github.com/islandora-interest-groups/Islandora-IR-Interest-Group]. There will be opportunity for cross polination and work between this and our group. One idea that is proposed is how to map metatags so that content can be harvested by Google Scholar. There are many use cases that can be created and we would encourage people to create some use cases as well as participate in the IR IG.

iCamp CT, Hartford, CT, 10/20-10/23 2015 [http://islandora.ca/camps/ct2015]  
If you are in the New England area, iCamp is coming to Hartford, CT. Registration is now open. We're also looking for submissions and the t-shirt logo contest.
